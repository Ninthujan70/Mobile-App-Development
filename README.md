Find Joker Assignment
Using RecyclerView create "face down card list", that's when clicked (one of the cards), open card value and suit. (You can use android vector graphics to create suits, if you like to) All cards can be opened. They are in random order, and they don't repeat. Card deck also has Joker. If joker has been opened within first 20 choices. A dialog opens that says : "Congratulations! You have won!" . However if you failed to find joker within these 20 cards, dialog appears, that says "You have failed to find Joker" . 

Extra points : Add "Play again" button. That doesn't refresh fragment. (Seamless transition between games).
